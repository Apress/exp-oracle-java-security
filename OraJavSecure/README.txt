from each Chapter in "Expert Oracle and Java Security" from Apress.

The javadev folder is referenced in Chapter 3.

There is also a second source code folder for Chapter 12, for those who do
not implement a hardened Oracle instance for Application Authentication.

The contents of the Supplement folder are described in the Supplement.pdf file.
